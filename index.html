        <h2>State Bird: Western Meadowlark</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/bird.jpg" height="300" alt="bird" />
        <p>The state bird of Oregon, the Western Meadowlark, is often seen perched on fence posts or shrubs in open grasslands, where it fills the air with its flute-like song. Similar in size to a robin, it has a bright yellow breast and a black collar. The bird uses its long, pointed bill to probe the soil for insects in the summer and seeds in the winter.</p>

            <h3>Cool Facts</h3>
            <li class="three">They build their nests on the ground, which are covered with a grass roof.</li>
            <li class="three">To feed, they utilize a technique called "gaping." This entails inserting their bill into soil and forcing it open, often revealing a variety of insects.</li>
            <li class="three">The Western Meadowlard is the second most popular choice for state bird. The first place spot belongs to the Northern Cardinal.</li>
            <li class="three">Male Western Meadowlarks are usually mated with two female birds at the same time!</li>
